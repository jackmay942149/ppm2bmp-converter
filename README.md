## 📂 (WIP) PPM to BMP Converter  
A simple utility I created to make sharing my raytracing `.ppm` files online easier. Currently a work in progress, but the goal is to eventually turn it into a fully functional Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool.

This project was also made possible with the help of the [Hex Editor Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.hexeditor), which helped me experiment with raw binary data during the development process.
