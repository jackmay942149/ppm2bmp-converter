## 📂 (WIP) PPM to BMP Converter  
A simple utility I created to make sharing my raytracing `.ppm` files online easier. Currently a work in progress, but the goal is to eventually turn it into a fully functional Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool.

This project was also made possible with the help of the [Hex Editor Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.hexeditor), which helped me experiment with raw binary data during the development process.

## 🚀 How to Try It Out  
If you want to try the tool out, download from the `src` folder, and build the `src/main.cpp` file from the top directory.  
The tool takes the `.ppm` file directly from the path `res/example.ppm` and will output directly to `res/out.bmp`.  
**Note**: Currently, there is a bug that mirrors the output from the original.
